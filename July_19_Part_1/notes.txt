Web Application : These are the applications, that which are to be called from various places rather than where they are created. 

If you want to make any distributed or robust applications, then 
we need the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways as 

(i) Scripting Languages

(ii) Programming Languages 

*** Scripting Languages are languages, that which are interpreted, 
during runtime they takes lot of time to execute... Programming languages are langauges, that which are compiled first, during runtime they takes very less time to execute ***

In Web applications, we can implement both 

(i) Client-Side Scripting

	Enables you to access the application from the same system.
	No Network traffic
	Execution will be faster 

(ii) Server-Side scripting 

	Enables you to access the application from the Server
	Network traffic is high
	A bit slower 

*** Any intranet based application w.r.t. No Security, please opt for Client-Side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. Min. Security, please opt for both client-side/server-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. High Security, Please opt for Server-Side Scrpting ***
