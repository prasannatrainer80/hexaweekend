Web Application : These are the applications, that which are to be called from various places rather than where they are created.  

If you want to make any distributed or robust applications, then we need the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways 

1) Scripting Languages  : These are the languages that which are interpreted, during execution they takes lot of time to execute.

In Web Applications, we can implement 

(i) Client-Side Scripting

   Enables you to access the application from Client-System

   No Network Traffic

   Execution will be faster 

(ii) Server-Side Scripting

   Network traffic is high

   A bit slower
